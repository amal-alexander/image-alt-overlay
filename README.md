# 🖼️ Image Alt Overlay

A lightweight Chrome Extension to visually inspect all image alt text **right on the page**.

---

## 🚀 Why I built this

Accessibility and SEO both rely on clear alt text — but verifying every image manually is tedious.  
I built this tool so anyone can:
- Instantly see every image’s `alt` attribute in the **center** of the image.
- Check which images are missing alt text.
- Spot SEO issues fast.
- Toggle overlays on/off with one click.

## ✨ Features

✅ Dims all images slightly for contrast.  
✅ Shows alt text **centered** on top of each image.  
✅ Supports long alt tags — wraps neatly, no overflow.  
✅ Click the extension icon again to remove overlays and restore the page.
